# Project Title: Aircraft Safety Risk Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for stakeholders regarding aircraft safety risks. The aim is to provide actionable recommendations for the new aviation division as the company expands into purchasing and operating airplanes.

## Business Problem
The company is interested in diversifying its portfolio by entering the aviation industry. However, there is limited knowledge about the potential risks associated with aircraft operations. The objective of this project is to identify which aircraft present the lowest risk for the company’s new business endeavor and provide insights to aid decision-making.

## The Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and contains aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. This dataset includes information about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

### Data Folder Structure
- *data/*
  - aviation_accident_data.csv (or other relevant files)

## Key Points
- The analysis will address missing values, data aggregation, and visualization techniques to support data-driven decision-making.
- The final deliverable will include three concrete business recommendations based on the findings from the data analysis.
- Emphasis will be placed on effectively communicating the results and insights to stakeholders, particularly the head of the aviation division.

## Methodology
1. *Data Cleaning*
   - Description of how missing values were handled.
   - Any transformations applied to the dataset.

2. *Data Analysis*
   - Overview of the analysis performed, including any statistical methods or models used.
   - Key metrics calculated (e.g., survivability rates, accident frequencies).

3. *Data Visualization*
   - Types of visualizations created (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).
   - Tools used for visualization https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oliver.seki/viz/AircraftRiskanalysis/InteractiveRiskanalysisDashboard?publish=yes(e.g., Tableau, Matplotlib).

## Conclusion
- Summary of the project’s findings and their implications for the company's aviation strategy.
- Importance of data-driven decision-making in entering the aviation industry.
